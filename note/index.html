                <p>Why does advertising work?</p>
<p>Most people do not know what they want or what they like. They have to be told. In fact, they like to be told.</p>
<p>It is maybe that they are so caught up with their day to day problems that they fail to think critically about the world. (It is a separate discussion on why people don't want to think critically (link will be here)).</p>
<p>Or maybe it is a simple matter of effort.</p>
<p>It is much easier for someone else to tell you what to do, or believe in, rather than you critically analyzing each component of the world.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't eat right before sleeping."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These social handed-down shortcuts work sometimes. After all, knowledge given by ancestors might hold significance due to it being tried and tested for generations across centuries. It seems obvious, feel obvious and deep research can't prove otherwise.</p>
<p>But consider something harmless like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Don't cut your nails in the night."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? You will realize in less than 3 seconds that it would be because people just a few centuries ago did not have access to lights as we have today. A nail can be cut in the dim light of a fireplace in the night, but it can fly randomly and pierce your feet if you aren't careful.</p>
<p>Let's make this worse.</p>
<p>Today it is normal to work in your 9-to-5. People who shit on that are the ones usually selling you snake oil - they are your "gurus" and will sell you $10k courses on how to be rich. You know the story.</p>
<p>But do you realize something? In both cases, doing a 9-to-5, or, buying self-help courses, you have done the same thing. The world told you "do things this way" and you landed at the former. Few folks told you to "do things this other way" and you landed at the latter. What's the solution?</p>
<p>Think.</p>
